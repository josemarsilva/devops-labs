## 1. Introdução

This document compiles and gathers a lot of information about **DevOps**.

## 2. Plano de Estudo

### Traditional Waterfall model

* Requirements and Gathering Analysis
* Design
* Implement
* Test
* Deploy
* Maintenance

### Limitations of Waterfall Model

* High amount of risk and uncertain
* No working software is produced until late during life cycle
* Once an application is in testing stage, it is very difficult to go back and change something that was no well-thought out in the concept stage
* Not a goot model for complex and object-oriented project
* Not suitable for the projects where requirements are at moderate to high risk of changing

### Agile Methodology

* In the agile methodology each project is broken up into several 'iterations'
* All iterations should be of the same duration (between 2 and 8 weeks)

* Tasks expected in DevOps Certification
  * Discover, Design, Develop

### Compare Waterfall vs Agile

* Waterfall: Analyze, Plan, Design, Build, Test, Deploy
* Agile: Analyze, Plan, Repeat { Design, Build, Test}, Deploy 

### Limitations of Agile

* Develop Team: priority is  **Change**
* Operation Team: priority is **Stability**

### DevOps Stages

* Version Control:
  * Maintains different versions of the code
  * Source Code Management
* Continuos Control
  * Compile , Validate, Code Review, Unit Testing, Integrating Test
  * Continuous Building
* Continuous Delivery
  * Deploying the build application to test servers, performance UAT
  * Continuous Testing 
* Continuous Deployment
  * Deploying the tested application on the prod server for release
  * Configuration Management and containerization
* Continuous Monitoring

### Source Code Management Strategies

* Centralized Version Control System
  * One central repository
* Distributed Version Control System
  * Many repositories
  * Every Programmer has your repository

## Configuration Management

* Configuration Management is the practice of handling changes sistematically so that a system maintains is integrity over time
* Configuration Management ensures that the current design and build state of the sistem is know, boot and trusted
* it doesn't rely on the tacit knowledege of development team
